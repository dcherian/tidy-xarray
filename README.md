# tidy-xarray

Authors: Emma Marshall. Deepak Cherian, Scott Henderson  
This is a project aiming to define a `tidy` framework for array datasets represented by Xarray data structures. Currently, we focus on geospatial use-cases and remote sensing datasets. We welcome community contributions, specifically from those working with model output datasets. 

## What is tidy data?

Tidy data is a concept defined by Hadley Wickham for tabular datasets in the R programming language. 

### Tidy data resources

## What are datacubes?

There are very helpful resources that conceptualize datacube representations of data. We highly recommend [this](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/datacubes.html#what-are-datacubes) page by openEO on datacubes for a comprehensive explanation of datacube characteristics and general computation patterns. 

## What do we hope to do? 

As listed above, there are many great resources about defining and working with geospatial array data. Our goal isn't to recreate the wheel, but to define specific guidelines for formatting Xarray data structures in ways that will simplify analytical workflows. In this repository you will find descriptions and explanations of `tidy` principles for Xarray data objects as well as examples of 'untidy' datasets and step-by-step explanations of the process of 'tidying' them. 

## Contributing

We would love your help and engagement on this project! If you have a dataset that you've worked with that felt particularly messy, or one that has steps you find yourself thinking back to as you work with new datasets, consider submitting it as an example! If you have input on tidy principles please feel free to raise an issue as well.
